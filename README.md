Using machine learning to predict Alzheimer's Disease

Despite over 100 years of research into Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), there are still no disease- modifying treatments available. 
AD is the most common cause of dementia and the lack of treatments is a great societal concern as AD affects 60,000 people in New Zealand, 
with potential to reach 150,000 people by 2050.
The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) project is aimed at making MRI data sets of the brain available to scientific community. 
Their hope is to facilitate future discoveries in the field of neuroscience.
The project presented here uses two of the following data sets:
- OASIS 1: Cross sectional MRI Data in Young, Middle Aged Nondemented and Demented Older Adults (416 subjects)
- OASIS 2: Longitudinal MRI Data in Nondemented and Demented Older Adults (150 subjects)
The goal was to analyse the data sets and attempt to predict whether a patient has dementia or not.
The program presented here analyses the two datasets mentioned above, using a range of different machine learning algorithms. 
The program is split into 3 parts: data processing, exploratory data analysis and modelling.
